# HolyShip
Holy Ship! is a free-to-play and not-for-profit point and click game developed by myself when studying some geographical aspects relevant to the Maritime Industry, such as the location of major ports, waterways - canals, straits, gulfs, seas - and some other relevant aspects such as meridians and tropics.
<br/><br/>
<br/> Once you select an option from the initial menu, a map will appear.
<br/> In the top-left corner you will see the instruction "Click on"... And where it is expected for you to click
<br/> It is as simple as that!
<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>The game is developed in LUA and made to run in LOVE2D.
<br/><br/>
<br/>The game code also allows for mobile, but I don't know how to make it available on Apple Store. However, I have found some issues when testing it on Ipad and on Iphone, so even if I knew how to publish it and make it available for free, it need some work.
<br/><br/>
<br/>If you just want to try the game I suggest downloading one of the executable files - depending on your system - and running it from your computer:
- For Windows: Download "Holy_Ship_Windows.zip", extract it in a folder and run the HolyShip.exe file - A NO BRAINER!
- For MacOS: WILL UPLOAD IT SHORTLY - Update: I am not a trusted developer so no MacOS version for the moment... Will work on it.
<br/><br/>
Disclaimer:
<br/>The map in the game was retrieved from ICS - Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers - website, where it is publicly available - Because I was studying for their exam :) 
<br/><br/>Since the game is not being used for commercial purposes I did not pursue a written authorization.
<br/><br/>Although the game has no copyright, the code was written by me, duplicating/replicating it and/or distributing it with our without commercial purposes is strictly forbiden.
<br/><br/>Come on, it is a very simple game, make something commercial out of it is just mean.
